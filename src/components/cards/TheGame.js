            Get ready to watch, remember, repeat! The Simon game is the exciting
            electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat
            random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the
            correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can
            challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and
            advance to higher levels. Keep track of your score as you challenge
            friends or try to beat your own high score.
